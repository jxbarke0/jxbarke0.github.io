        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I remember the iconic moment my dad updated the family PC from Windows 3.0 to Windows 3.1. Of course, back then
            I was only interested in the color scheme changes and the new features in Paintbrush. I spent hours drawing pictures
            and saving them to my personal 3.5" floppy disk, which was a beautiful sea green color.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this time, I also learned to use the Command Prompt and MS-DOS Shell
            to play games. One of my favorite games was called "Dr. SBAITSO," which was not a game at all but a psychologist simulator.
            You could ask it questions through text input and have a mock-therapy session, where it would respond verbally with our fancy new sound card.
            The program didn't have the best pronunciation, and certainly didn't give the best advice, but my family had a lot of fun
            with the good doctor, testing its limits and patience. We still jokingly mispronounce "mistaken" as he did, "mis-TACK-en."
        </p>
        <p>
            Thus began my love of programming. The grade school I attended had a relatively new computer lab full of old Apple computers,
            and my family computer was a PC, so I like to think I got the best of both worlds. The first computer I bought was a PowerMac G4,
            which I used for music projects and Photoshop, and designed a website for my band. That site, along with the constant desire
            to have the flashiest MySpace page, taught me my first HTML skills. Luckily, my band's GeoCities page has long
            since been decommissioned, and MySpace completely changed their format once people stopped using it, so there is no evidence of my past crimes against HTML.
            I have to say, HTML5 is much easier than previous iterations, and the things we can do with HTML5 combined with CSS and JavaScript make front-end design an entertaining experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            My real love, though, is back-end development. It's something I've wanted to do since my first experiences with the Microsoft Command Prompt.
            When I moved across the country for work on the east coast, my first job there involved using IBM AS400-based software with the familiar
            black screen and green text. I loved how quick the program was, and how you could easily get the program to do what you wanted it to do once you
            learned the right commands. The
            company eventually changed over to a full web-based application, which was less pliable but more user-friendly. Learning to use that application
            was more involved, as navigation was slower and its quirks were harder to overcome. Not to be outdone by the stubborn personality of a modern program,
            I soon got a new position providing tech support for the application's internal and external users. I wasn't in Development yet, but I worked closely
            with the Dev team when problems arose, and full-stack development became my goal.
        </p>
        <p>
            After attending <a href="https://www.learncodinganywhere.com/" target="_blank">The Tech Academy</a> in 2018, I was hired to their development team as a full-stack developer
            where I have been working since. We use C# in an ASP.NET MVC application with a React-Redux front end. We also planned the architecture for the next phase
            of our application using .NET Core microservices containerized with Docker in Azure. Aside from those technologies, I have a huge love for jQuery and the
            Wild West that is JavaScript. I am always looking to learn new languages and frameworks, most recently having built an app using Angular. See my
            <a href="#portfolio">Portfolio</a> section for details on my learning journey. Cheers!<br /><br />

                    I have experience using the tragic early-2000s versions of most Office applications, and survived each upgrade to slightly more modern versions.
                    This includes Word, Excel, Outlook, SharePoint, and Access.<br /><br />
                    <p>Yes, lots of people have experience with these, but I would be terrified of working with a person who was not. These programs are important to know because they are so common.</p>

                    <h4>Teamwork!</h4>
                    I have been extremely lucky to have worked with so many great people over the years. The best part about being on a team is learning. Everyone I've
                    worked with has had something to offer: some life experience to pull from, some wisdom to impart, or they're just fun to work with. You learn a lot
                    about a person if you're stuck in a room with them for 40 hours a week.<br /><br />
                    My most recent experience working with a team was working with other developers in using Agile Scrum methodology to add features to the school website. Any project has its roadblocks,
                    and it's good to have a team to rely on for bouncing ideas and getting different perspectives on a problem. More importantly, everyone has their strengths.
                    Some people on the team were better at the smaller, more repetitive tasks. Some members excelled at the design work. Of course, this being my website,
                    I have to say I'm great at them all, but there is nothing more satisfying than working with a team on a complicated task and having it come out perfectly.

                    <h4>Reliability Through Independence</h4>
                    Yes, the term "self-starter" is overused, but its meaning is important. If you are driven purely by explicit instruction,
                    you might be a computer program. Having the independence and will to make our own decisions is what makes us human. In this way, we are all "self-starters."
                    However, being able to exercise an appropriate degree of independence in a professional environment is an asset; it's easier on management and it's easier
                    on your team.
                    I've always considered myself an independent person, but it is evidenced by my recent position working for an Operations department.
                    This position was 100% remote, meaning I worked from home for six years. Telecommuting demands the personality of a true self-starter. I have proven myself
                    capable of working independently while collaborating with a team at the same time. I can get the work done without being prodded or micromanaged.

    <h3>Live Project (C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ASP.NET MVC)</h3>
    <p>
        This project took all the skills I had learned so far and put them to practical use in a team environment using Agile and Scrum methodology.
        I was assigned to a team responsible for adding certain features to the Tech Academy website. Specifically, the pages I worked on were designed for the school's
        Job Placement Director to pull student information from a database to track hiring patterns and other analytics, as well as post bulletins for students.
        You can read a full synopsis of my work on the project <a href="https://github.com/jxbarke0/Tech-Academy-Projects/blob/master/LiveProjectCodeRetrospective.pdf" target="_blank">on my GitHub page</a>.
        Here are some highlights:
    </p>
    <div class="container">
        <p>
            One of the first user stories I worked on involved adding sort functionality for a screen that displayed student data along with the total number of job applications
            they had submitted within the last week and overall.
        </p>
        <img src="img/liveproject1.png" /><br /><br />
        <p>
            This required the use of nested lambda expressions to pull the needed information from the database and sort by the calculated figures.<br />
            Another challenging user story was adding a method to one of the controllers that would calculate average applications per hired student, the most common company that hires students, and the most
            common job title held by new hires, all requiring queries of database information from multiple tables:
        </p>

        <p>Below is code I wrote designed to take in a concatenated string and create a simple CSV file with it:</p>
        <img src="img/liveproject3.png" /><br /><br />
        <p>Next, putting my JavaScript experience back to use, I added buttons to the bulletins page to allow the user to add markup language when creating a new bulletin:</p>
        <img src="img/liveproject4.png" /><br /><br />
        <p>One of the last user stories I worked on involved pulling a list of items that included data from two different tables, and also included a third table if a certain flag was set to "true":</p>
